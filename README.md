# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

The Tutor tab connects to a ChatGPT-powered assistant focused on the IB system in Jordan for 11th grade. To enable responses, supply an OpenAI API key via the `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here npx expo start
```

## Google Sign-In

Google authentication requires OAuth credentials. Provide the client ID when starting the Expo app and both the client ID and secret when running the Express backend:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id npx expo start

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret node server.mjs
```

For convenience, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your own values.
